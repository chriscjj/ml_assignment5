# 🧠 ML Assignment 5: Clustering Algorithms on Iris Dataset

## 📌 Description
This repository contains the implementation of **KMeans** and **Hierarchical Clustering** on the **Iris dataset**, as part of Machine Learning Assignment 5.  
The goal is to apply unsupervised clustering techniques to group data based on similarities in features without using the target labels (species).

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

### 1️⃣ KMeans Clustering
- Unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into K clusters.
- Suitable for the Iris dataset due to its numerical and well-separated features.
- Clusters visualized using **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.

### 2️⃣ Hierarchical Clustering
- Builds nested clusters using a bottom-up approach (Agglomerative).
- Displays data relationships using a **dendrogram**.
- Clustering visualized with PCA-reduced data.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Iris Dataset  
- **Source:** `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`  
- Contains 150 samples, 4 features:  
  - Sepal Length  
  - Sepal Width  
  - Petal Length  
  - Petal Width
